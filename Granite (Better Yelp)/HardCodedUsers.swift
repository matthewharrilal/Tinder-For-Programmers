    // The reason we are making this optional is for the reason is because we know that the users dont need these values to make their account they add it later once they make it their account and the reason we can put this in a separate file is because it will be out of range because since we are passing the data from table view cell to the next view controller we would pass this in

        // So we already know that we use initializers as the blueprints for instances to come of the class so essentially what we are doing right now is that we have to set the argument label username equal to the property username we have created for the class so basically what we are doing is that every instance that comes as a result of this class is going tobe initalized with this username argument label that is of type string and we can pass in any string which will corespond to the users unique username not to be confused with their uid

        //And the reason we have to make a new initializer is because if we dont then it is going to have us work off the original initalizer we have and the reason we do not want that is because that original initalizer as we know sets the blueprints of all our other instances in addition to that the stuff we are initalizing in the has nothing to do with the data from firebase where as this we are actually retrieving the data from firebase through taking a snapshot

    //So essentially what we are going to be doing next is what we call boilerplate code and what that essentially means is that that is code that is called multiple times with little or no alteration but ends up being neccessary and this is very good sometimes because it can give a developer more direct control over their code meaning if thney have more control over specific migrations in their code that may occur and so if they want a different thing happening somewhere they can implement that

    // So let us talk about what is happening here and lets differentiate the difference between nscoder and nscoding so first off nscoder and what it essentially does  is that it lets us transfer objects made in our code through memory and through differrent subclasses whiles NSCoding what that essentially does is that it implements two methods that your class must use which is to encode and decode meaning we can encode the data we get from firebase  as well as decode it locally basically giving as an entry as well as a secure departure
    // this part of the code what we are essentially doing is that we are encoding the data we have for each of the properties of the users and we encode it locally
