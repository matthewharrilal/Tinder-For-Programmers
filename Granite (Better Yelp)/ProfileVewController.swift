        // in the next line of code what is essentially happening is that well first we are making this picker of type uiimagepickercontroller and what that it essentially does is that it gives us all the properties of the uiimagepickercontroller within this picker controller and then from there we make it its own delegate and like we said that gives us our own set of blueprints and in the next line of code we are basically saying that we can allow editing meaning if they can modify the existing image
        
        // In the next line of code what is essentially happening is that we are giving a source for these photos to come from and for that source we are using the uiimagepickercontroller photo library meaning we have access to all the default photos

                    // So essentially what is happening here is that we are basically saying thay when we press the save changes button we want to save the bio text and the reason we commented out the two lines of code here is because lets think about this we are declaring this new let constant called values and setting that equal to the snapshot from firebase and casting it as a dictionary and we know we cast them as a dictionary because we want to have a key and return the users info as a value and in the second line of code what we are essentially doing here is that we are saying that we want the user bio text equal to the dictionary key userBio now the problem with that is we are basically saying that we want the userbio text equal to the dictionary key but when we start the app and tap on the user the text is initially empty therefore it is going to store it as empty, thats why whenever we started the app the user bio was stored as an empty string in firebase so to go about this what we did was commentented the line out and then from there what we have is take this database reference to firebase to our users database and esserntially say we want to update our userBio child with the userbio text and we there declare it as a key value pair as you can see we set the text equal to the key userBio
                    
                    // And the reason we dont want to initalize is it because for this simple reason and that reason being is that every user has to have a username an email and a password ass well as their fullname to create their account but not ever user has to have a bio thereofore as we know every instance of a class represents a new user therefore we dont initalize t because if we did that means that every new user would have to have a bio
                    
                    // The next step is to be able to save their bio therefore when they restart the app their bio is still there and this incorporates user defualts
