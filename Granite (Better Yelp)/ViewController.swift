        // In the next line of code we are declaring a new let constant called logInViewController and what this let constant essentially does is that we take the storyboard constant that we declared in the previous line of code and what we do with that is that we are using this new let constant we are declaring to reprsent the transition that occurs when the the user wants to go from wherever they are in the main storyboard and go to the view controller they want to end up in by giving the view controller an identifier for where they want to end up in and depending on where you call this function that how the transition is going to occur for example we call this function in the log out button action because when we press the logout button we want to be transition to the view controller that we gave the identifier for

        // In the nex line of code what we are essentially doing is that we are saying that our 2d location eaning the zooming ability is that we want it to reference the latitude and longitude spans that we declared in he previous line of code and we set that equal to 0.01 thefore that makes sense we only want to be able to zoom in at a span of 0.01 north east south and west
